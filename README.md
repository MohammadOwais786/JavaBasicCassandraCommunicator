# JavaBasicCassandraCommunicator
This is a basic Java command line application to access the data stored in Apache Cassandra Database on a local server.<br/>
I tried to implement the code in Objected Oriented and DAO patterns. <br/>
The data can be added, updated, deleted and viewed.<br/>
The tools used in building this application are <br/>
  (1) Eclipse <br/>
  (2) Apache Maven 3.3.9<br/>
  (3) Apache Cassandra 3.9<br/>
  (4) Java version 1.8.0_101<br/>
I also included the CQL commands I used to create the KeySpace and Tables.<br/>
